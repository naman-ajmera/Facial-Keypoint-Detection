# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
This is a competition posted on kaggle.com.
The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images.
Each predicted keypoint is specified by an (x,y) real-valued pair in the space of pixel indices. There are 15 keypoints, which represent the following elements of the face:
left_eye_center, right_eye_center, left_eye_inner_corner, left_eye_outer_corner, right_eye_inner_corner, right_eye_outer_corner, left_eyebrow_inner_end, left_eyebrow_outer_end, right_eyebrow_inner_end, right_eyebrow_outer_end, nose_tip, mouth_left_corner, mouth_right_corner, mouth_center_top_lip, mouth_center_bottom_lip.
I was able to achieve accuracy of around 75% on validation data.
